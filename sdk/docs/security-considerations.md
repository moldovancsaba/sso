# Security Considerations

## Client-Side Storage

1. Tokens are stored in localStorage:
   - Access tokens are ephemeral and short-lived
   - Refresh tokens have longer expiration periods
   - Consider implementing additional encryption for refresh tokens

2. XSS Protection:
   - Implement Content Security Policy (CSP)
   - Sanitize all user inputs
   - Use HttpOnly cookies when possible

## Token Management

1. Token Expiration:
   - Access tokens expire after a short period
   - Automatic refresh mechanism in place
   - Implement proper error handling for failed refreshes

2. Token Rotation:
   - New refresh tokens are issued after use
   - Old refresh tokens are invalidated
   - Prevents token reuse attacks

## API Security

1. Transport Security:
   - Always use HTTPS
   - Verify SSL/TLS certificates
   - Keep dependencies updated

2. Error Handling:
   - Avoid exposing sensitive information in errors
   - Implement proper logging
   - Handle rate limiting gracefully

## Client Application Security

1. Client Credentials:
   - Keep client secrets secure
   - Use environment variables
   - Never expose in client-side code

2. User Sessions:
   - Implement proper logout functionality
   - Clear all tokens on logout
   - Handle session timeouts

## Best Practices

1. Regular Security Audits:
   - Review dependencies for vulnerabilities
   - Update security policies
   - Monitor for suspicious activities

2. Compliance:
   - Follow OWASP guidelines
   - Implement proper logging
   - Regular security training
