## MongoDB Atlas IP Access Restriction

### Issue Description
MongoDB Atlas connection was failing because the database was not configured to accept connections from all IP addresses. This caused connection timeouts and authentication failures.

### Resolution
Fixed by:
1. Logging into MongoDB Atlas dashboard
2. Navigating to Network Access section
3. Adding a new IP address entry with 0.0.0.0/0 to allow connections from anywhere
4. Alternatively, adding specific IP addresses for better security

### Testing
- Verified database connections work from development environment
- Confirmed authentication flows are working
- Tested user creation and login functionality

### Notes
- For production, consider restricting IP ranges to known addresses
- Document all allowed IP addresses in deployment documentation
- Regular audit of IP whitelist recommended

## Authentication Endpoint Internal Server Error

### Issue Description
The `/api/auth` endpoint was returning an "Internal server error" when attempting to login. The error occurred due to several underlying issues:

1. Missing CORS headers causing cross-origin request failures
2. Overly strict timestamp validation
3. Insufficient error handling and logging
4. No proper separation of concerns in error management

### Resolution
Fixed in commit 0d0a74b (2025-06-05)

#### Changes Made
1. Added CORS Support
   ```typescript
   res.setHeader('Access-Control-Allow-Origin', '*');
   res.setHeader('Access-Control-Allow-Methods', 'POST, OPTIONS');
   res.setHeader('Access-Control-Allow-Headers', 'Content-Type');
   ```

2. Improved Timestamp Validation
   - Replaced strict regex validation with a more flexible Date object validation
   - Added proper error messages for invalid dates
   ```typescript
   try {
     const date = new Date(timestamp);
     if (isNaN(date.getTime())) {
       throw new Error('Invalid date');
     }
   } catch (e) {
     return res.status(400).json({ 
       error: 'Invalid timestamp format. Use ISO 8601 format (e.g., 2025-04-13T12:34:56.789Z)' 
     });
   }
   ```

3. Enhanced Error Handling
   - Added specific error cases with detailed messages
   - Implemented proper error logging
   - Separated user management errors from authentication errors
   ```typescript
   try {
     // User management logic
   } catch (e) {
     console.error('User management error:', e);
     return res.status(500).json({ error: 'Failed to manage user data' });
   }
   ```

4. Added Detailed Logging
   - Added request logging
   - Added validation failure logging
   - Added error condition logging

### Testing
After implementing these fixes:
- Cross-origin requests work correctly
- Invalid timestamps are properly handled with clear error messages
- User management errors are properly isolated and reported
- All error conditions are properly logged for debugging

### Notes
- The timestamp format follows ISO 8601 with milliseconds (e.g., 2025-04-13T12:34:56.789Z)
- CORS headers are set to allow all origins (*) for development - should be restricted in production
- Error messages are now more specific and helpful for debugging
